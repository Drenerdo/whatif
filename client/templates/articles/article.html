                  <p><small>Who owns the copyright in user-generated content on social media?  For instance, who owns a photograph that a user posts on his Facebook account, if s/he makes it publicly visible?  While social media platforms cannot claim ownership of such content, platform terms of use can include licenses to use the content, creating issues when third parties re-use it without the poster’s knowledge or permission.</small></p>

                  <p><b>The Law: Social media and orphaned works</b></p>
                  <p><small>Under the Berne Convention and other international copyright treaties, registration is no longer a formal predicate to the creation of a copyright interest. Thus, ownership of a person’s creation should be automatic, and considered to be such person’s legally protected intellectual property, creating the right to enforce such creation by going after those who exploit it without the owner’s permission.  However, simultaneously, terms of service on most social platforms require the user to agree to some variation of the following, from Instagram’s terms: “[a] non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service.”  These terms are rarely read by the user, but constitutes a legally binding contract as long as the user continues to have an account with the platform.  That license, allowing the user’s content to be displayed around the social platform, easily enables other users to take the content and re-post it elsewhere without attribution to the original creator.</small></p>

                  <p><b>The Response</b></p>
                  <p><small>In 2013, the United Kingdom passed the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act, almost immediately nicknamed the “Instagram Act” by the British press. The Act changes British copyright law to permit the commercial exploitation of images where information identifying the owner is missing (i.e., "orphan works"), by placing the work into something called an "extended collective licensing" scheme. Since most digital images on the internet today are orphans, because the metadata has been stripped away by a large organization or is otherwise missing, millions of photographs and illustrations are swept into such schemes where a law like the UK’s is controlling.</small></p>
                   <p><small>No such law currently exists in the United States.  However, in Agence France-Presse (AFP) v. Morel (S.D.N.Y. 2013), a federal jury awarded photographer Morel $1.2 million in damages after determining that news agency AFP willfully infringed his copyrights in certain images he posted to Twitter following the Haiti earthquake of 2010. Morel successfully argued that a stipulation in Twitter’s terms of service that users retain their rights in the content they post – except for a license they grant solely to Twitter and its partners – rebuts AFP’s claim that Twitter intended it to be a third-party beneficiary of the license.  The problem of orphan works underlies the more fundamental issue of ownership of user-generated content in the first place, especially in a world of rampant downloading, embedding and re-posting of UGC.</small></p>
