        <h1>Copyright</h1>
        <p>Congress enacted the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 in an effort to keep legislation on par with the development of the Internet. At the time, the Act was praised as “landmark legislation” as it provided a means of protection for copyrighted work, for which previous Copyright laws were not equipped to handle. With more than a decade passing since the enactment of the DMCA, technology has continued to evolve, leading to a compromise on the effectiveness of the act. Two areas in great need of reform are the Counter Notice Provision (§ 512(g)(3)) and the Anti-Circumvention Provision (§1201).</p>
